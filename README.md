**Technologies Used:**

* HTML: The foundation of my portfolio, ensuring a structured and accessible presentation of my work.

* CSS: To create a visually appealing and responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on all devices.

* JavaScript: For the top page scroll up button and navigation drop-down menu. Bringing interactivity and dynamism to the portfolio.

**Custom Icons:**
I've integrated **Boxicons** to add a personal touch to the user interface, to provide a cohesive visual language throughout the site.

**Custom SVG Design:**
I've utilized **Haike** to create bespoke SVG designs for the web page with wavy and layer designs.

**Color Palette:**
The colour scheme of my portfolio is used by **Color Hunt**. The selected palette reflects my personality and complements the overall theme.
